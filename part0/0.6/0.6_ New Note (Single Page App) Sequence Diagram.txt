# author: Hally / Harriette Bianan
# date: June 17, 2020

# from previous part (0.5), browser sent 4 HTTP request to display the SPA page
# HTTP GET requests from html, css, javascript, and json
# now the user will submit a new note but..
# when submitting the form, it contains no "action" nor "method" attributes to define how to send the input data


# user created and submitted a new note
# now, browser sends an HTTP POST request to the server 
browser -> server : HTTP POST https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note_spa


# the Request Header tells the server that the Content-type of the data is represented
# in the JSON format. Without this header, the server would not know how to correctly
# parse the data
note over server :
REQUEST HEADERS:
    - Content-type: applicaiton/json
    
REQUEST PAYLOAD:
{content: "new note", date: "2020-06-18T01:28:20.233Z"}

Request call stack:
    - sendToServer @ spa.js:43
    - form.onsubmit @ spa.js:59
end note


server --> browser : Status Code 201 : {"message":"note created"}


note over browser :
server does not ask for a "redirect";
browser stays on the same page
and sends no further HTTP request
end note
